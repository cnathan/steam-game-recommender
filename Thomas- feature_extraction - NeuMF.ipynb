The purpose of this project is to construct a Recommender System (RS) to predict the top-k unplayed games for a user based user history, users with similar tastes in genres, and games with similar genres to those the user likes.\n","\n","We use a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam). The dataset consists of three CSV files. This includes a file titled ‘Games’ contains titles of games and purchasable game content, ratings, price in USD, and release dates, a ‘Users’ CSV containing information regarding the users who have reviewed the games in the ‘Games’ CSV, and a ‘Recommendations’ CSV, which offers whether a user recommends the product they reviewed. Note that personal user information is not accessible within the files.\n","\n","In this project we will use collaborative filtering to make recommendations. There are two types of collaborative filtering, user-based and item-based, which differ in how they compute similarities and make recommendations:\n","\n","User-based collaborative filtering focuses on the relationships between users. It identifies users who are similar to the target user based on their past interactions with items (e.g., ratings, purchase history). Recommendations for the target user are generated by considering the preferences of similar users. In other words, it recommends items that were liked by users who have similar taste as the target user.\n","\n","Item-based collaborative filtering focuses on the relationships between items. It computes similarities between items based on user interactions with them, such as ratings or purchase history. Recommendations for a target user are generated by identifying items that are similar to those the user has liked or interacted with in the past. In other words, it recommends items that are similar to those the target user has already liked.\n","\n","In summary, user-based collaborative filtering focuses on finding similar users to the target user and recommends items based on the preferences of those similar users, while item-based collaborative filtering focuses on finding similar items to those the target user has liked and recommends items based on these similarities.\n","\n","After exploring the data, we identify several challenges and methods we can use to overcome them, increasing the scope of the project significantly."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from scipy import stats\n","from
